# Line-following-vehicle
Note: This project is implemented in Webots

This project comprises of four different robotic cars which tracks and follows a black line etched on a white surface. Once a robotic car (say Car red) reaches it's destination it autonomously commands the next robotic car to move and replace the red car's initial location. And while tracking the black line the robotic cars also avoid the obstacles placed in their route.

# Sensors used:
I have modelled all the sensors that I have used for my robotic cars instead of incorporating the pre-existing "proto=sensors" and by this I mean, I designed it's outlook without using the various complete sensor models available. I have used distance sensors for both tracking the black line on white surface as well to avoid obstacles. To establish communication between them, I have modelled and used emitter-reciever modules.

# Working:

Check out the video attached below to visualize how my robotic cars work as a whole.
